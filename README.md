Snipper
=======

Snipper is a small utility which enables you to paste text Snippets without the need to search for it inside files or webpages. The App provides storage for 9 Snippets, which can be pasted anywhere through global shortcuts.
The update to version 1.1 brings additional text input features, the german localization and the keyboard number displayed in front of each Snippet title.
